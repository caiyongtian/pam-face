PAM Face
========

PAM Face is a Linux Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) for password-less face authentication using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org). Only a webcam is required.

Per default the password authentication is set as fallback. Two-factor authentication is also possible. The module has to be configured by the `pamface-conf` program.

Installation
------------

Please note that PAM Face is currently in development.

### Remarks

PAM Face is not compatible with OpenCV 3.1 as there is a bug that has been fixed in a later version: <http://answers.opencv.org/question/82294/cant-get-predict-confidence/>

You will get the error: `'int' object has no attribute '__getitem__'`
